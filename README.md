## Description 

This repository is where I developed Tarmity-s-Portfolio. Not only do we work on code and issues here, I also publish the latested updates and functions. This source code is available to everyone under the Free Software Foundation, Inc. https//fsf.org/.

I also built this website to show future employer's and to have all my work on show in one simple click of a button.
